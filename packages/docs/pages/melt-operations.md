# Melt Operations

Melt operations pay Lightning invoices by "melting" proofs at the mint. The flow is implemented as a saga so proofs are reserved safely, fees are clear before paying, and recovery is possible if the app crashes mid-payment.

## Overview

The melt operation saga provides:

- **Crash Recovery**: Operations can be recovered on startup
- **Proof Safety**: Proofs are reserved before any mint interaction
- **Fee Transparency**: Fee reserve and swap fee are known up front
- **Pending Tracking**: Pending melts can be checked and finalized later

## API Surface (`coco.ops.melt`)

The canonical API is exposed through `coco.ops.melt`:

- `prepare({ mintUrl, method: 'bolt11', quoteId })` prepares an operation from a canonical melt quote
- `prepare({ mintUrl, method: 'bolt12', quoteId })` prepares a BOLT12 offer melt from a canonical melt quote
- `execute(operationOrId)` executes the prepared operation
- `getByQuote({ mintUrl, method, quoteId })` resolves an operation from a persisted quote id
- `refresh(operationId)` checks a pending melt and returns the latest operation state
- `cancel(operationId)` cancels a prepared melt
- `reclaim(operationId)` reclaims a pending melt when rollback is allowed

Create and resurface quote payment requests through `coco.quotes.melt` before
preparing a melt operation:

- `create({ mintUrl, method: 'bolt11', methodData: { invoice }, unit? })` creates and persists a canonical quote row only
- `create({ mintUrl, method: 'bolt12', methodData: { offer, amountSats }, unit? })` creates and persists a canonical quote row only
- `get({ mintUrl, method, quoteId })` loads a canonical quote by full identity
- `listPending({ method? })` lists canonical quote rows that have not reached `PAID`
- `refresh({ mintUrl, method, quoteId })` checks the remote quote state and persists the canonical quote update

## Operation States

Melt operations progress through the following states:

| State          | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`         | Operation created, nothing reserved yet             |
| `prepared`     | Proofs reserved, fees calculated, ready to execute  |
| `executing`    | Swap/melt in progress                               |
| `pending`      | Melt started, waiting for quote to settle           |
| `finalized`    | Melt succeeded, change claimed, operation finalized |
| `rolling_back` | Rollback in progress (reclaim swap being executed)  |
| `rolled_back`  | Operation cancelled, proofs reclaimed               |

## Prepare → Execute Flow

### Prepare

Quote creation is separate from operation preparation. Create the quote first,
then prepare the operation once the user is ready to reserve proofs:

```ts
const quote = await coco.quotes.melt.create({
  mintUrl,
  method: 'bolt11',
  methodData: { invoice },
});

const prepared = await coco.ops.melt.prepare({
  mintUrl,
  method: 'bolt11',
  quoteId: quote.quoteId,
});

console.log('Quote:', prepared.quoteId);
console.log('Amount:', prepared.amount);
console.log('Fee reserve:', prepared.fee_reserve);
console.log('Swap fee:', prepared.swap_fee);
console.log('Needs swap:', prepared.needsSwap);
```

For BOLT12 offers:

```ts
const quote = await coco.quotes.melt.create({
  mintUrl,
  method: 'bolt12',
  methodData: { offer, amountSats: 1000 },
});

const prepared = await coco.ops.melt.prepare({
  mintUrl,
  method: 'bolt12',
  quoteId: quote.quoteId,
});
```

Internally, the service:

1. Loads the canonical quote row
2. Selects proofs to cover the quote amount + fee reserve
3. Determines if a pre-swap is needed (`needsSwap`)
4. Reserves the input proofs and builds change outputs

### Execute

Execution moves the operation to `executing` before contacting the mint. It then:

1. Runs a swap if exact proofs are needed
2. Sends the melt request to the mint
3. Updates the operation based on the mint response

```ts
const result = await coco.ops.melt.execute(prepared.id);

if (result.state === 'finalized') {
  console.log('Invoice paid');
  console.log('Change returned:', result.changeAmount);
  console.log('Effective fee:', result.effectiveFee);
}

if (result.state === 'pending') {
  console.log('Invoice pending');
}
```

If the mint returns `PAID`, the operation is finalized immediately. If the mint returns `PENDING`, the operation moves to `pending` and must be checked later.

## Handling Pending Operations

Pending operations should be checked until they finalize or roll back:

```ts
const operation = await coco.ops.melt.refresh(operationId);

if (operation.state === 'finalized') {
  console.log('Melt finalized');
} else if (operation.state === 'rolled_back') {
  console.log('Melt rolled back');
}
```

`refresh` queries the mint for the quote state when the operation is pending, performs any needed finalize or rollback work, and returns the latest stored operation.

The operation returned by `refresh()` already includes settlement details when the melt has finalized:

```ts
const operation = await coco.ops.melt.refresh(operationId);

if (operation.state === 'finalized') {
  console.log('Change returned:', operation.changeAmount);
  console.log('Effective fee:', operation.effectiveFee);
}
```

`changeAmount` and `effectiveFee` are recorded for newly finalized melt operations. Older finalized melt records created before settlement tracking was added may not have those values.

## Rollback Behavior

Rollbacks reclaim proofs when an operation is cancelled or fails:

- Prepared operations can be rolled back immediately
- Pending operations are only rolled back if the quote is confirmed `UNPAID`
- Rolling back a pending melt uses a reclaim swap, so the final amount may be reduced by fees

## Crash Recovery

On startup, the melt service recovers operations automatically:

- `init` operations are cleaned up and deleted
- `prepared` operations are left for user decision
- `executing` operations are recovered based on mint status
- `pending` operations are checked and finalized or kept pending
- `rolling_back` operations log a warning (manual intervention may be needed)

## Events

```ts
coco.on('melt-op:prepared', ({ operationId, operation }) => {
  console.log('Prepared melt', operation.amount);
});

coco.on('melt-op:pending', ({ operationId, operation }) => {
  console.log('Melt pending', operation.quoteId);
});

coco.on('melt-op:finalized', ({ operationId, operation }) => {
  console.log('Melt finalized', operation.changeAmount, operation.effectiveFee);
});

coco.on('melt-op:rolled-back', ({ operationId, operation }) => {
  console.log('Melt rolled back');
});
```

## Implementation Notes

- Built-in `manager.ops.melt` support covers `bolt11` and `bolt12`
- Operations are locked per id; concurrent calls throw `OperationInProgressError`
